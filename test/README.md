# Unit Test 

This directory contains unit test files for our project. Each file corresponds to a specific module or functionality in our main codebase. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that all functions behave as expected under a variety of conditions.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
cd test
python -m unittest
```
